# gas-probe agent guide

Scaffolded with Thruput 0.29.2, template `minimal`.
This project contains a `no_std` Rust contract compiled to RV32.

## Start here

Read `README.md` if present, the project manifests and lockfiles, and any
`AGENTS.md` in the directory you will edit. Those files describe this project's
current dependencies and workflow; the scaffold version above is historical.
Preserve dependency and toolchain pins unless the task includes a migration.

Install the maintained skill with `thruput skill install` if it is absent,
then read its entry point:

```console
thruput skill show
```

Then load only the guidance needed for the task:

- Contract logic, storage, or Rust tests: `thruput skill show contracts`.
- Profiles, keys, deployment, or local nodes: `thruput skill show cli`.
- Generated bindings or client calls: `thruput skill show typescript`.

These commands read the installed files offline; they do not install or update skills.
Use APIs supported by the project's resolved SDK version. If an instruction
does not match the CLI, check `thruput --version` and the command's `--help`.

For more detail, use `thruput docs export --output <new-directory>` with a new
temporary directory outside the project. Start at its `index.md`, then read the
relevant pages or section bundle. Reading these files does not need a server.

## Contract layout

- `src/implementation.rs`: contract state, errors, and `#[contract]` logic.
- `src/lib.rs`: the `no_std` gate, `sdk::declare_mock_contract!()`, and re-exports.
- `src/main.rs`: the RV32 bin wrapper. Keep contract logic in `implementation.rs`.
- `tests/test.rs`: host mock-executor tests.
- `tests/test_rv32.rs`: RV32-executor tests.
- `tests/integration.rs`: RPC integration tests.

## Verify contract changes

- `cargo test`: run the host tests.
- `thruput build`: build the artifact, by default at
  `target/thruput/gas_probe.rv32a`. Use the reported path when
  build output is configured elsewhere.
- `thruput test`: build and test the RV32 artifact. Run both host and RV32
  tests for contract changes: release builds wrap on integer overflow where
  host builds panic.
- `thruput test --integration`: run RPC tests against a managed, ephemeral
  local node. This also requires a compatible `hog-devnode` runtime.

Builds and tests need the pinned Rust toolchain and Thruput registry access.
Report missing prerequisites or failed checks rather than reporting an unrun
check as successful. Use the project's selected network for deployment.

## Preserve the build setup

- Keep features `entrypoints`, `dev`, and `thruput-integration-test`; the
  compiler macros, CLI, and test harness use those names.
- Do not make `dev` a default feature: feature unification would pull `sdk/dev`
  and `std` into guest builds.
- Keep the self-referential dev-dependency
  `gas-probe = { path = ".", features = ["dev"] }` for host tests.
  A contract that depends on this one must forward its `dev` feature too.
- Keep the RV32 `[[bin]]` name `gas_probe`. If renaming the package,
  update both that name and the `extern crate` identifier in `src/main.rs`.
- Use `thruput build` for RV32 builds. It supplies the `build-std` overlay
  from `.cargo/contract.toml`; a bare Cargo RV32 build misses that configuration.

Keep `.cargo/config.toml`, `.cargo/contract.toml`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, and
`thruput.toml` at the Cargo workspace root. Build reads project profiles from
that root, not from a member's `thruput.toml`.

When joining an existing workspace, merge the required settings into its root
files without overwriting unrelated settings. Keep target rustflags in one
place: duplicate `-Tgroundhog-rv32.ld` flags cause `region 'CODE' already defined`.
